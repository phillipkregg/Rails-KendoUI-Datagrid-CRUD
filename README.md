## DataSource and Grid CRUD example

The `expenses` controller is a generated using the following command:

```shell
    rails generate scaffold expenses title amount:decimal
```

No further modifications to the server-side code are applied. To see the needed DataSouce settings for rails-compatible CRUD operations, check `expenses/index.erb` view.
